		<h3>Both are a community gathering spot</h3>
		<p>
		The 1908 building that is home to the Riverview Cafe and Wine Bar has been a neighborhood destination for over a century. At one point the space was the home of a soda fountain, and it was the place to take a date, bring the family on a lazy weekend afternoon, and catch up on the latest happenings around town.
		<br>When we opened the Riverview Cafe in 1998, we wanted the building to once again be the hub of community life and a local destination and be:
		- a place for neighbors to gather over a cup of coffee or glass of wine
		- a place where parents and kids would be welcome 
		- a great place for a romantic date night.
		<br>More than fifteen years later we've seen first dates, babies grow up, and neighbors become like family.
